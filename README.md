## How to run

Get [FinEtools](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl).
The FinEtools package is  registered, and hence one can do just
```julia
] add FinEtools
```
Only version 0.7, 1.0, and the nightly builds of Julia are supported. 

The documentation  is published as [Github pages](https://petrkryslucsd.github.io/FinEtools.jl).
